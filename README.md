
## Introduction

Welcome, this repository contains the software required to run the Opula Ledger application. A software designed for accounting within the VR roleplay Fractured Thrones. It is designed simply for streamlined use in VR overlays. Allowing for currency and material management by users efficiently. There are three major functions of the application: Ledger, Craft, Business.

The goal of these three functions are to address the most common accounting needs within FT.

### Ledger

The ledger function is designed to simply account for coin and material goods passing through a player via trade. A user creates an entry, accounts the total coin and material transaction and saves it to the ledger. The ledger will provide the active coin and material total.

### Craft [Future]

The craft function allows for quick access to the crafting capabilities of a player. Showing the material requirements, expected material cost, and profit of an item. This also can track the time requirements for crafting with a start and end session time. 

Future data tracking can allow for the application to focus on specifics required for the player's profession. For instance, crafting will only show the available craftable items for the specific profession of a player.

### Business [Future]

The business function can manage an inventory separate from the player's active total within Ledger. A business has its own coin and material total as well as the ability to track transactions, income, profits, and realized material cost.

Future data tracking can allow for players to share a business, allowing concurrent access to the same inventory.

## Far Future Ideas

Once live data is available for the application (read: In the future), players who wish to use the application in a live session with have persistent data tracking and data specialization. This can allow for DM tools to be used for economy tracking and viewing player inventory totals and transactions.
